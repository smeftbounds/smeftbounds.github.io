# smeftbounds.github.io
This is a github repository for collecting and
displaying the best limits on SMEFT Wilson coefficients. We will
explain the bound submission and automated display process for new
contributors and the minimal coding steps included for that. We will
elaborate on how we keep it open-source and involve minimal (or null)
human maintenance. You will find a template in which
bounds-related information needs to be submitted. We invite
suggestions on the future utilities that should be included in the
repository.
