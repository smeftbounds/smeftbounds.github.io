# smeftbounds.github.io
This is a github repository for collecting and
displaying the best limits on SMEFT Wilson coefficients. The bound submission and automated display process need minimal coding from users. It will be kept open-source and involve minimal (or null)
human maintenance. You will find a template in which
bounds-related information needs to be submitted. We invite
suggestions on the future utilities that should be included in the
repository.
